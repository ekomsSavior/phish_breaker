## Recommended Workflow

1. `unshorten_and_extract.py` â†’ Unwrap shortlinks, extract domain, path, and scrape hidden links  
2. `bucket_sweeper.py` â†’ Sweep Google buckets for `.html` phishing files  
3. `ultra_recon.py` â†’ Perform deep forensic analysis (WHOIS, abuse, headers, SSL, forms, metadata, Shodan, VirusTotal, Nmap, DIRB, reporting links)

You can stop after step 2 for a fast sweep or run all the way through for a full forensic report.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ekomsSavior/phish_breaker.git
   cd phish_breaker
   ```

2. Install dependencies 
   ```bash
   # requests for Python scripts
   sudo apt install python3-requests

   # curl, nmap, whois, dirb (if not already installed)
   sudo apt install curl nmap whois dirb
   ```

3. The `reports/` folder is already included in the repo â€” all reports will be saved there.

4.  Add your API keys: optional-

If you want to enable Shodan and VirusTotal lookups, open `ultra_recon.py` and paste in your API keys:

```python
SHODAN_API_KEY = "your_shodan_api_key_here"
VT_API_KEY = "your_virustotal_api_key_here"
```

Without keys, those sections will gracefully skip during scans.

## Usage

Run any tool directly
```bash
python3 unshorten_and_extract.py
python3 bucket_sweeper.py                  # or
python3 bucket_sweeper.py --wordlist mylist.txt
python3 ultra_recon.py
```

All `.txt` reports will be saved inside the `reports/` folder with timestamps for easy case tracking.

#### Tips

IN BUCKET SWEEPER:

- Always include the **trailing slash** if you want it to sweep like a folder
  ```
  https://storage.googleapis.com/examplebucket/
  ```

- You can also target a specific file
  ```
  https://storage.googleapis.com/examplebucket/rmdc77.html
  ```
